# Test Automation System Design & Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

The Test Automation System is designed to facilitate the management and conduct of campus shortlisting tests. This system aims to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for administering tests, managing student data, and ensuring test integrity.

## 2. System Overview

The Test Automation System consists of the following key components:

- **Frontend Application**: A responsive web application accessible from both mobile and desktop browsers.
- **Backend Server**: A backend server responsible for user authentication, data management, and serving APIs.
- **Database**: A relational database system to store user data, test results, and authentication credentials securely.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication mechanism to manage user sessions and authorize access to protected resources.
- **Time Monitoring**: Client-side module to track the duration of each test session and prevent users from taking screenshots.
- **Tab Switching Prevention**: Client-side logic to detect and prevent users from switching tabs during the test.
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based infrastructure to handle a large number of concurrent users.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Tools for monitoring system performance and user activity for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
- **Deployment**: Containerization and orchestration for automated deployment and scaling of the application.

### 3.2. Components Description

- **Frontend Application**: The frontend application is built using **React**.js or Angular to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface accessible from both mobile and desktop browsers.
- **Backend Server**: The backend server, implemented using Flask or Django, handles user authentication, data management, and serves APIs for communication with the frontend.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is chosen as the relational database system to store user data, test results, and authentication credentials securely.
- **Authentication**: Flask autontication module is implemented to manage user sessions and authorize access to protected resources.
- **Time Monitoring Module**: A client-side JavaScript module tracks the duration of each test session and prevents users from taking screenshots during the test.
- **Tab Switching Module**: Another client-side JavaScript module detects and prevents users from switching tabs during the test to maintain focus and prevent cheating.
- **Scalable Cloud Infrastructure**: The application is deployed on a scalable cloud infrastructure, such as AWS, to handle a large number of concurrent users efficiently.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring system performance and user activity, providing insights for auditing and troubleshooting.

## 4. Detailed Component Design

### 4.1. Frontend Application

The frontend application is developed using React.js or Angular to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface. It includes the following modules:

- **User Authentication**: Provides user login, registration, and password reset functionalities.
- **Test Management**: Allows administrators to create, manage, and schedule tests.
- **Test Interface**: Provides the interface for students to take tests, including question display, submission, and time tracking.
- **Dashboard**: Displays statistics and insights for administrators, such as test completion rates and student performance.

### 4.2. Backend Server

The backend server, implemented using Node.js with Express.js, provides the following functionalities:

- **User Authentication API**: Handles user login, registration, and password reset requests using JWT-based authentication.
- **Test Management API**: Manages tests, questions, and test schedules, allowing administrators to create, update, and delete test data.
- **Data Access Layer**: Interacts with the PostgreSQL database to perform CRUD operations on user data, test data, and authentication credentials.
- **Middleware**: Implements middleware for authentication and authorization to restrict access to protected resources.

### 4.3. Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database stores the following entities:

- **Users**: Stores user authentication credentials, including username, email, and hashed passwords.
- **Tests**: Contains test information, including test name, duration, and associated questions.
- **Questions**: Stores questions for each test, including question text, options, correct answers, and associated metadata.
- **Test Results**: Records test submissions, including student ID, test ID, answers submitted, and test completion status.

### 4.4. Authentication

JWT-based authentication is implemented as follows:

- **User Registration**: When a user registers, their password is hashed and stored in the database.
- **User Login**: Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client, which is used for subsequent requests to authenticate the user.
- **Password Reset**: Users can request a password reset email, which contains a unique link with a token for resetting the password.

### 4.5. Time Monitoring & Tab Switching Prevention

Client-side JavaScript modules are used to track time and prevent tab switching during tests. These modules run in the browser and communicate with the backend to record test durations and prevent cheating.

### 4.6. Scalability & Deployment

The application is deployed on a scalable cloud infrastructure, such as AWS EC2 instances, with load balancing and auto-scaling configurations to handle fluctuations in traffic. Docker and Kubernetes are used for containerization and orchestration, enabling automated deployment and scaling of the application.

## 5. Conclusion

The Test Automation System provides a comprehensive solution for managing and conducting campus shortlisting tests securely and efficiently. By leveraging modern web technologies, scalable cloud infrastructure, and robust security measures, the system ensures a seamless experience for both administrators and students while maintaining test integrity.
